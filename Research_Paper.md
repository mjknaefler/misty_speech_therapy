I. Introduction
Socially assistive robots are increasingly being explored for their potential to support children with various developmental needs, including those with language impairments [1]. These robots can serve as engaging tools in therapeutic interventions, potentially enhancing children's attention, improving social behaviors, and sustaining their level of engagement [1,2]. Research has shown that the presence of a robotic assistant can provide incentives for children to participate in therapy sessions and improve their verbal and communication skills [2]. 
In this study, Misty's primary function is to engage children in comfortable conversations by asking leading questions about themselves, with the intention to create a low-risk, judgment-free  environment conducive to verbal interaction with the goal of increasing engagement rates of the children during therapy sessions. This approach is supported by findings that children can comfortably interact with robots [1], and that a positive perception of a robot's capabilities can help sustain their engagement [2]. By focusing solely on facilitating conversation without directly addressing speech issues, Misty aims to encourage children to communicate more freely.
A key aspect of effective human-robot interaction, particularly in therapeutic contexts, is the robot's ability to communicate effectively, not only through verbal means but also via non-verbal cues such as facial expressions and body language [2,3]. The capacity for a social robot to recognize and express emotional states can positively influence children's perception of its intelligence and complexity, which in turn can help sustain their engagement over longer periods [2]. To further enhance engagement, Misty is designed to express emotions through facial expressions and arm movements, simulating body language that can foster a greater sense of connection with the child. The ability of social robots to recognize and express emotional states is considered crucial for attracting and sustaining children's attention [1,2]. 
Considering these factors, the development of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) robot like Misty, designed to engage children with speech development problems through interactive conversations and expressive non-verbal cues, aligns with the growing interest in leveraging social robots as assistive tools in speech therapy [1,2]. By focusing on creating a comfortable and non-judgmental environment through engaging questions and the simulation of body language via facial expressions and arm movements, Misty aims to foster a positive interaction that encourages children to communicate more freely [1,2]. The potential for such a robot to act as a valuable tool for speech-language therapists lies in its ability to sustain children's engagement and provide a low-risk context for verbal interaction [1,2].
